    <h1>Democracy and our village school</h1>
    <p><strong>Resident:</strong> “Why might the village school close?” </p>
    <p><strong>Parent:</strong> “Because the Ofsted inspector said it was ‘Inadequate’.” </p>
    <p><strong>Resident: </strong>“And why was it marked Inadequate?”</p>
    <p><strong>Parent:</strong> The Ofsted report said “Weak governance and ineffective support and challenge from the local
        authority mean that pupils have been let down by the quality of education they receive for far too long.” </p>
    <p>and</p>
    <p>“There have been too many ‘sticking plaster’ solutions and there is still no long-term sustainable plan for the school.
        Consequently, the capacity for sustained improvement is weak”</p>

    <p>
        As parents we are told that we can choose the school that we send our children to. This ability to choose is supposed to
        create a competitive environment that will improve standards. Within this framework <span class="scc">Surrey County Council</span> are supposed
        to work with their schools to improve them. As you can see from the above Ofsted comments, over a sustained period
        this did not occur. Due to this parents started to move their children to other schools and the school faced a downward
        spiral. <span class="scc">Surrey County Council’s</span> role is now to find a solution to the problem of their own making. If they fail to
        find a solution the school will close. We as parents have understandably neither faith nor trust in the <span class="scc">Surrey County
        Council</span>. Please join us to fighting for the school, please amplify the village’s voice.
