        <h1>Democracy and our village school</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>Resident:</strong> “Why might the village school close?” </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Parent:</strong> “Because the Ofsted inspector said it was ‘Inadequate’.” </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Resident: </strong>“And why was it marked Inadequate?”</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Parent:</strong> The Ofsted report said “Weak governance and ineffective support and challenge from the local
            authority <span class="scc"><a href="https://www.surreyconservatives.org.uk/">(Surrey County Council)</a></span> mean that pupils have been let down by the quality of education they receive for far too long.” </p>
        <p>and</p>
        <p>“There have been too many ‘sticking plaster’ solutions and there is still no long-term sustainable plan for the school.
            Consequently, the capacity for sustained improvement is weak”</p>

        <p>
            As parents we are told that we can choose the school that we send our children to. This ability to choose is supposed to
            create a competitive environment that will improve standards. Within this framework
            <a href="https://www.surreyconservatives.org.uk/"><span class="scc">Surrey County Council</span></a> are supposed to work with their schools to improve them. As you can see from the
            above Ofsted comments, over a sustained period this did not occur. When Ofsted came to inspect the school it
            was graded as “Inadequate”. Due to this parents started to move their children to other schools and the school
            faced a downward spiral. As the school was rated Inadequate the Government procedures mean that the school must
            be removed from local authorities
            <span class="scc"><a href="https://www.surreyconservatives.org.uk/">(Surrey County Council)</a></span> "control" and handed to the Regional School's Commissioner (RSC). Their role is
            to find a new governance structure for the school. This in general means having an Academy Chain “sponsor the
            school”, meaning the school becomes part of that Academy's chain. Being a church school the Guildford Diocesan’s
            Academy Chain the “Good Shepherd Trust” was given an opportunity to sponsor the school. After carrying out due
            diligence they decided not to sponsor the school. However Surrey County Council with whom we must still liaise
            have told us that as we are a rural school there are “other options”. They have not provided any clarity even
            at a high level as to what these options are. Neither have they provided a timescale. If the District School’s
            Commissioner cannot find an Academy Chain to sponsor us and the “other options” do not provide a positive outcome
            then there will be a “consultation” with all interested parties about the closing of the school. If the school
            does close then
            <a href="https://www.surreyconservatives.org.uk/"><span class="scc">Surrey County Council</span></a> must provide a school place for all the children within 45 minutes of their home.
            We also believe (this has not been confirmed) that the
            <a href="https://www.surreyconservatives.org.uk/"><span class="scc">Surrey County Council</span></a> will have to pay the transport costs of getting the children to these alternate
            school. If these alternate school are not rated Good or Outstanding the children will be in no better place from
            an educational stand point. As you can understand due to the uncertainty and the risk of having their child do
            a 1.5 hour daily commute to school more parents are withdrawing their children.
        </p>
        <p>
        Given the history indicated by the Ofsted report and
        <a href="https://www.surreyconservatives.org.uk/"><span class="scc">Surrey County Council's</span></a> refusal to engage with us about past mistakes the Friends of Ripley C of E School have
        neither faith nor trust in
        <a href="https://www.surreyconservatives.org.uk/"><span class="scc">them</span></a>. We do not feel that our elected officials will use whatever political capital they
        have to bring about the best outcome for the school. Our belief is that they will follow the path of least resistance.
        </p>
        Please join us to fighting for the school, please amplify the village’s voice.
